# Brain-transcriptome-analysis

This repository contains scripts related to the analyses present in the paper "Brain transcriptome analysis reveals gene expression differences associated with dispersal behaviour between range-front and range-core populations of invasive cane toads in Australia; Boris Yagound, Andrea J. West, Mark F. Richardson, Daniel Selechnik, Richard Shine, Lee A. Rollins; bioRxiv 2021.09.27.462079; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.462079".

It contains two files:

- <Pre-processing_alignment_quantification.sh>
Scripts to perform data pre-processing, alignment and gene expression quantification.

- <Gene_expression_analysis.R>
R scripts to perform differential expression analysis, differential variability analysis, functional analysis and data representation.
